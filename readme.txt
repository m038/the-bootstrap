A WordPress Theme based on Bootstrap, from Twitter

== Description ==

The Theme is 100% responsive - you do not need a seperate mobile-Theme with this layout.
It has a seperate Sidebar just for image pages, to make it a special place to show your pictures!
The Bootstrap is fully compatible with WordPress SEO by Yoast!

Please note:

Due to design restrictions in Bootstrap, the navigation menu can only be two levels deep, while the parent menu item only serves as a headline for the child menu items and can not be accessed over the navigation menu.
